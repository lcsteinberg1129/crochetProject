            <li>Dc in 4th ch from hook, then dc in each of next 2 stitches. You've just finished the first block of Row 2!</li>
            <li>To create the second block of this row, work into the space between the third and fourth dc stitches on the left side of the first block (assuming that you are working right-handed crochet). Into that space, sl st, ch 3 (counts as first dc),
              3 dc.</li>
            <li>
              Turn and ch 6. Dc in 4th ch from hook, then dc in each of next 2 stitches.</li>
            <li>Then, (sl st, ch 3, 3 dc) once in each of the two blocks from Row 2.</li>
            <li>Keep growing your square by repeating the steps for Row 3, adding one more block each time. Do this until the row that you're on is the length you want the finished square to be. You'll have a triangle that's the first half of your C2C square.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul> Decrease
            <li>Sl st in each of the 3 dc stitches of the first block on the right. Then work your blocks as normal across the row (repeating the steps above) until you get to the last block.</li>
            <li>Do not work a block in the last block on the left side of the work. Instead, simply sl st into that space. Turn your work and repeat until you get down to one block at the corner opposite the beginning of your work. Finish off and weave in
              your ends.</li>
