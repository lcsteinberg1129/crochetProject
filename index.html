            <li>Dc in 4th ch from hook, then dc in each of next 2 stitches.</li>
            <li>Turn and ch 6.</li>
            <li>Dc in 4th ch from hook, then dc in each of next 2 stitches. You've just finished the first block of Row 2!</li>
            <li>To create the second block of this row, work into the space between the third and fourth dc stitches on the left side of the first block (assuming that you are working right-handed crochet). Into that space, sl st, ch 3 (counts as first dc),
              3 dc.</li>
            <li>
              Turn and ch 6. Dc in 4th ch from hook, then dc in each of next 2 stitches.</li>
            <li>Then, (sl st, ch 3, 3 dc) once in each of the two blocks from Row 2.</li>
            <li>Keep growing your square by repeating the steps for Row 3, adding one more block each time. Do this until the row that you're on is the length you want the finished square to be. You'll have a triangle that's the first half of your C2C square.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul> Decrease
            <li>Sl st in each of the 3 dc stitches of the first block on the right. Then work your blocks as normal across the row (repeating the steps above) until you get to the last block.</li>
            <li>Do not work a block in the last block on the left side of the work. Instead, simply sl st into that space. Turn your work and repeat until you get down to one block at the corner opposite the beginning of your work. Finish off and weave in
              your ends.</li>

        <div class="panel panel3"><ul><li>ROW 1: Make a double crochet into the 3rd chain from your hook and in each chain across. Chain 1 and turn (135 double crochet)</li>
          <li>ROW 2: Work a double crochet into the very first stitch. *In the next stitch, work a front post double crochet, work 1 double crochet in the next 2 stitches. Repeat from * across until 1 stitch remains. Work a front post double crochet in the last stitch and 1 double crochet into the top of the turning chain. Chain 1 and turn.</li>
          <li>ROW 3: Work a double crochet into the very first stitch. *Work a double crochet in the next stitch and a front post double crochet in the next two stitches. Repeat from * to last two stitches. Next, work 1 double crochet into each of the remaining 2 stitches. Chain 1 and turn.</li>
          <li>Repeat ROWS 2 and 3 until blanket is desired length. Be sure to end on a row 2 for a neat edge.</li>
          <li>To Finish: Leave at least 6 inches for your tail. Cut yarn. Yarn over your hook and pull through the last stitch of your row and tighten. To weave in all yarn ends, thread your yarn in your tapestry needle and go in between the stitches one way and back the other way. This will keep your project from coming apart.</li>

        <div class="panel panel4"><ul><li>Start by working any even number of chain stitches. I began with 18 chain stitches for my sample.</li>
          <li>Next, work a single crochet stitch into the fourth chain from the hook.</li>
          <li>Then, chain one, skip one chain, and work a single crochet stitch into the next chain.</li>
          <li>Continue down the row in this pattern: chain one, skip one chain, and single crochet into the next chain. Basically, you are working a row of single crochet stitches separated by chain one spaces. You should end with a single crochet stitch in the last chain of the row.</li>
          <li>
Turn your work. Chain 2 and single crochet in to the first chain 1 space skipping the single crochet stitch.</li>
          <li>Then, chain one, skip the next single crochet stitch, and work a single crochet into the next chain one space. Repeat this pattern (chain 1, skip 1 stitch, single crochet in the next chain 1 space) until you reach the end of the row. You will end with a single crochet stitch into the end chain space from the first row (see image below).</li>
          <li>So, again, you are alternating single crochet stitches and chain one spaces, but this time you are always working your single crochet stitches into the chain one spaces of the previous row.</li>
